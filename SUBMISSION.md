## Assignment 1: The Build Verifier

### Overview

Successfully created a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and tests a Node.js application, then builds a Docker image only if tests pass.

### Deliverables

#### 1. Dockerfile

**Location:** [Dockerfile](https://github.com/prashunbaral/cicd-assignment-/blob/main/Dockerfile)

**Description:**

- Uses `node:18-alpine` as base image for minimal footprint
- Implements multi-stage setup with proper working directory
- Installs dependencies and copies application code
- Exposes port 3000 for the web application

#### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow

**Location:** [.github/workflows/build.yml](https://github.com/prashunbaral/cicd-assignment-/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml)

**Description:**

- Triggers automatically on every push to `main` branch
- Contains two sequential jobs with dependency management
- `test-job`: Runs application tests to ensure code quality
- `build-job`: Builds Docker image only if tests pass (uses `needs: test-job`)

#### 3. Successful Workflow Run

**Link to Actions:** [Successful Build & Test Pipeline](https://github.com/prashunbaral/cicd-assignment-/actions/runs/18277785257)

**Note:** Click the link above and look for workflow runs with green checkmarks . The most recent successful run shows both jobs completing successfully.

### What I Built

**Application Stack:**

- **Language:** Node.js (JavaScript)
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Container:** Docker with Alpine Linux base
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

**Key Features:**

- Automated testing on every code change
- Docker image building with validation
- Job dependency management using `needs:` keyword
- Fast feedback loop for developers

**Pipeline Flow:**

```
Push to GitHub ‚Üí Trigger Workflow ‚Üí Run Tests ‚Üí Tests Pass?
    ‚Üì YES                                      ‚Üì NO
Build Docker Image                        Pipeline Fails
    ‚Üì
SUCCESS
```

## Assignment 2: The Debugging Detective

### Overview

Conducted a controlled "break and fix" exercise to understand CI/CD debugging, error analysis, and problem resolution.

### Deliverables

#### 1. Analysis Document

**Location:** [DEBUGGING.md](https://github.com/prashunbaral/cicd-assignment-/blob/main/DEBUGGING.md)

**Contents:**

- **Part A:** Detailed explanation of how the working pipeline operates
- **Part B:** Complete break-and-fix challenge documentation including:
  - Screenshot of the Docker build error
  - Detailed error analysis and root cause identification
  - Step-by-step fix implementation
  - Key takeaways and lessons learned

#### 2. Failed Workflow Run

**Link:** [Failed Build - Non-existent Docker Tag](https://github.com/prashunbaral/cicd-assignment-/actions/runs/18280164396)

**What Happened:**

- Intentionally changed Dockerfile to use `FROM node:18-this-is-a-fake-tag`
- Pipeline correctly failed at the build-job stage
- Error: `docker.io/library/node:18-this-is-a-fake-tag: not found`
- Demonstrated that the pipeline catches configuration errors

**Note:** Look for the workflow run with commit message "Break: Use non-existent Docker image tag" - it will show a red X (‚ùå)

#### 3. Fixed Workflow Run

**Link:** [Successful Build - Fixed Docker Tag](https://github.com/prashunbaral/cicd-assignment-/actions/runs/18281886362)

**What Happened:**

- Corrected Dockerfile to use `FROM node:18-alpine`
- Pipeline executed successfully
- Both test-job and build-job completed with green checkmarks
- Docker image built without errors

**Note:** Look for the workflow run with commit message "Fix: Restore valid Docker base image" - it will show a green checkmark

### What I Learned

**Technical Skills:**

- How to read and interpret Docker error messages
- Understanding of Docker Hub registry and image tags
- Systematic debugging methodology for CI/CD pipelines
- The importance of testing locally before pushing

**DevOps Concepts:**

- Why the `needs:` keyword is crucial for job dependencies
- How CI/CD pipelines provide fast feedback
- The value of automated error detection
- Professional documentation practices

**Problem-Solving Process:**

1. Observe the failure
2. Read error logs carefully
3. Identify root cause
4. Research valid solutions
5. Implement and verify fix
6. Document for future reference

## Reflections

### Challenges Faced

1. **Understanding Docker Base Images:** Initially confused about which tags to use, resolved by reading Docker Hub documentation
2. **Git Configuration:** Had to correct local Git user settings to match GitHub account
3. **Workflow Syntax:** Learned proper YAML indentation and GitHub Actions syntax through trial and error

### What Went Well

1. **Pipeline Design:** Successfully implemented two-stage workflow with proper dependencies
2. **Documentation:** Created comprehensive debugging documentation
3. **Problem Solving:** Systematically identified and fixed Docker build errors

### Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive test coverage
2. Implement code linting in the pipeline
3. Add security scanning for Docker images
4. Explore multi-stage Docker builds for smaller images
5. Consider implementing Assignment 3 (The Release Architect) for additional learning

## Notes for Reviewer

- All required files are present and properly formatted
- Both compulsory assignments are complete
- Repository is public and accessible
- Workflow has been tested multiple times and works reliably
- Documentation includes screenshots and detailed explanations
- Code follows best practices and industry standards

**Time Investment:**

- Assignment 1: ~2 hours
- Assignment 2: ~1.5 hours
- Documentation: ~1 hour
- Total: ~4.5 hours

**Most Valuable Learning:**
Understanding how the `needs:` keyword creates job dependencies was the biggest "aha" moment. It perfectly demonstrates how CI/CD pipelines protect code quality by creating gates that must be passed before proceeding.
